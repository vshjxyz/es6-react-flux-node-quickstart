es6-react-flux-node-quickstart
====

A simple template powered by webpack that allows you to use
 * ES6 client and server side
 * React templates
 * Flux architecture and Facebook's Dispatcher
 * Isomorphic architecture using react-async
 * Express.js
 * SCSS + compass support

I'm trying to [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) because I've seen far too many es6 projects with thousands of dependencies / optimizations that are way too hard to approach.

As I'm learning this tech stack I will create tags on the steps that took me to the repository's `HEAD`

Installation
---
Just run `npm install` and use `npm run dev` to run the development server with hot reload.

Visit `localhost:8080` after the bundle is marked as VALID

Directory structure
---
will be here when the project will stabilize

TODOs
---
 * ~~Find out how webpack is building the production's assets~~
 * ~~Go Isomorphic (using react server/client side)~~
 * ~~Find out how react handles routing and enable pushState~~
 * Connect to db?
 * Use Flux's stores with offline capabilities?
 * Use Alt/Fluxible/Anything suitable to set-up proper isomorphic state hydrate/dehydrate
 * Find out how to test react/flux properly
